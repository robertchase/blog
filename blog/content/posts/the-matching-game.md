Part of the philosophy (epistemology) of mathematics
is pondering how numbers came to exist.
To imagine that numbers were *always there*, or that they exist in relation to some *ideal numeric form* is too mystical for me.
Perhaps our brains
are wired to group and collect things in a way that naturally leads to mathematical thinking.
The *matching game* is a kind of *number origin story* that makes this assumption.

### the matching game

In the matching game, we start with a named collection of items.
Take, for instance, this collection of Xs which we have named “three”:

`X  X  X`

This game involves matching up other sets of items, item by item, with “three” and observing the results.
If we match up this set of Ys:

`Y  Y`

it turns out that not all of the Xs have a match. We call this condition `less than`.
Our collection of Ys is `less than` “three”.

If we match up this set of Zs:

`Z  Z  Z  Z`

it turns out that not all  of the Zs have a match.
We call this condition `greater than`.
Our collection of Zs is `greater than` “three”.

If we match up this set of Ws:

`W  W  W`

it turns out that each item from both sets has a match.
When this condition happens, we can call our matching set by the same name as our original set.
Our collection of Ws is “three”.

After playing the matching game for a while with differently named sets, like “one”, “two”, etc, it might become obvious that there are some rules about the relationships between sets.
For instance:

* take an item away from “three” matches a “two”
* combine a “two” and a “three” and the result matches a “five”

Basic math follows.
This shows how math can be understood a as shortcut for the matching game, in the same way that multiplication is a shortcut for addition.
