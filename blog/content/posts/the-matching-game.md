Part of the philosophy (epistemology) of mathematics
is pondering how numbers came to exist.
To imagine that numbers were *always there*, or that they exist in relation to some *ideal numeric form* is too mystical for me.
Perhaps our brains
are wired to group and collect things in a way that naturally leads to mathematical thinking.
The *matching game* is a kind of *number origin story* that makes this assumption.

### the game

The matching game starts with a named collection of items.
Take, for instance, this collection of Xs which has the name “three”:

`X  X  X`

The game involves matching up other sets of items, item by item, with “three” and observing the results.
Matching with this set of Ys:

`Y  Y`

reveals that not all of the Xs have a match. This condition is called `less than`.
This collection of Ys is `less than` “three”.

Matching with this set of Zs:

`Z  Z  Z  Z`

reveals that not all of the Zs have a match.
This condition is called `greater than`.
This collection of Zs is `greater than` “three”.

Matching with this set of Ws:

`W  W  W`

reveals that each item from both sets has a match.
This condition means that the matching set has the same name as our original set.
This collection of Ws is “three”.

After playing the matching game for a while with differently named sets, like “one”, “two”, etc, it becomes obvious that there are some rules about the relationships between sets.
For instance:

* take an item away from “three” matches a “two”
* combine a “two” and a “three” and the result matches a “five”

Basic math follows.
This shows how math can be understood a as shortcut for the matching game, in the same way that multiplication is a shortcut for addition.

### what this means

This might be how numbers really work.
But I don't know.

What I know is that this explains one way that numbers *might* be a natural outcome of
normal things that our brains do, like
recognizing patterns,
putting things in groups
and comparing things.
