1. Divide one by three. The answer is an infinite procession of 3s following a decimal point.

2. Divide one person by three. The answer is one person, with two left over.

In the first case, there is not really an infinite procession of 3s.
We like to think that there is, but have no answer for the question of what appears at infinity.
If the answer is “there is no infinity, the threes just keep going”, then I have no argument.
I simply assert that as long as you keep calculating the next digit, the answer will be three.
I also assert that introducing “infinity” into this discussion is just a fabrication that “pretends” something like “forever” makes sense in calculations.
For as far as we can imagine performing this calculation, there is always one more calculation that we can imagine beyond that.

In the second case, the “infinite” procession is gone.
