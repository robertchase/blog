Starting with one, the remainder of the numbers proceed.
Adding one to itself, gives rise to *two*.
From there *three*, and so on.
There is no end to this procession. Ever.

To say “just keep doing it forever” is not an instruction that can be followed by any mortal being.
To say “let’s pretend that you just keep doing it forever” is exactly that: pretending.

Infinity&mdash;when it means *the final step* of "repeat over and over without end"&mdash;doesn’t exist.
There is never a final step. Isn't that what *without end means*? Right?

I’m not forming a *proof*, I’m just saying that “doing it forever” doesn’t have any practical equivalent.
You can’t do it. It won’t ever happen. There is not an infinity *there*.
At the end of the number line is always one more number.

Always.
