Wisdom seems hard to find these days.
We probably aren't any more foolish than we've ever been,
but our ability, and our propensity, to indiscriminately broadcast every half-baked idea
makes us seem, on the whole, rather unwise.

What makes for wisdom?

Wisdom is not one thing, but a collection of things working together.
For ease of expression, I've reduced this collection of things to a terse formula&mdash;*in no way am
I suggesting that wisdom is exact or mathematical*.

# w = *fn*(k, e, j)(h, r)
