Wisdom seems hard to find these days.
We probably aren't any more foolish than we've ever been,
but our ability, and our tendency, to randomly broadcast every half-baked idea
makes us seem, on the whole, rather unwise.

What makes for wisdom?

Wisdom is not one thing, but a collection of things working together.
For ease of expression, I've reduced this collection of things to a terse formula&mdash;*in no way am
I suggesting that wisdom is exact or mathematical*.

# w = *f*(k, e, j)(h, r)

### translation:

Wisdom is a function of
*knowledge* and *experience* and *judgment*
regularly evaluated in *humble* *reflection*.

# humility and reflection

One definition of wisdom is *the fruit of a considered life*.
This definition is vague, but captures the key idea that wisdom requires *consideration* or *reflection*.
Reflection, if it leads to wisdom, cannot be full of self-defense, but has to be founded in humility.
Humble reflection honestly evaluates the past:

* Why did it matter to me that I was right?
* Was my initial guess very close?
* Do I really understand what she was saying?
* Was I pretending that I knew more about something than I really do?

If you're full of yourself, you won't ask these questions, or you won't be able to answer them honestly.

# knowledge

Knowledge provides a framework for being in the world.

Knowledge is not a bunch of facts, but the structure and relationship of those facts.
When a new piece of information comes along,
it is understood in light of a lot of other things that have already been encountered.

For instance,
when I come across a species of bird that I've never seen before,
I immediately realize that I'm looking at a bird,
but I also realize that something is different about this particular bird.
I don't have to start the learning process from scratch just because
this bird isn't exactly like some other bird I've encountered.

What's happening here?
Somehow I've used all of my *bird knowledge* to recognize a new kind of bird.
I doubt that my brain compared this new bird to every other fact in my head until it decided it was looking at a bird.
It is much more likely that all of that bird knowledge was already arranged in some convenient way
that made the comparison simple.

What I already know about birds helps me to understand this new species,
but what I know about birds doesn't change very much.

On the other hand, if I learned that birds don't really fly,
but instead have large invisible bodies that support their visble parts, creating the illusion of flight,
what I know about birds would change tremendously.
Such a radical discovery would likely cause a massive restructuring of my collection of facts about birds.

# experience

Experience improves the quality of our knowledge.

Suppose I lived on a remote island where the only birds were penguins or ostriches.
When I traveled and encountered my first sparrow, I might not even think it was a bird.
After my initial surprise at being informed that a sparrow is also a bird,
my knowledge of birds would become more robust.
As I encountered new kinds of flying birds, I would easily be able to classify them as birds,
even if I couldn't tell you exactly what kind of birds I was seeing.


# judgment

Judgment guides our choices between alternatives.

A bad choice shows bad judgement.
I know a choice is bad when I experience the unwanted consequences of that choice.
Wisdom acknowledges the mistake, and prepares for a better choice&mdash;a better judgement&mdash;next time.

As long as experience informs our knowledge,
our judegments will improve. This is wisdom in action.
