Wisdom seems hard to find these days.
We probably aren't any more foolish than we've ever been,
but our ability, and our tendency, to randomly broadcast every half-baked idea
makes us seem, on the whole, rather unwise.

What makes for wisdom?

Wisdom is not one thing, but a collection of things working together.
For ease of expression, I've reduced this collection of things to a terse formula&mdash;*in no way am
I suggesting that wisdom is exact or mathematical*.

# w = *f*(k, e, j)(h, r)

### translation:

Wisdom is a function of
*knowledge* and *experience* and *judgement*
regularly evaluated in *humble* *reflection*.

# humility and reflection

One definition of wisdom is *the fruit of a considered life*.
This definition is vague, but captures the key idea that wisdom requires *consideration* or *reflection*.
Relection, if it leads to wisdom, cannot be full of self-defense, but has to be founded in humility.
Humble reflection honestly evaluates the past:

* Why did it matter to me that I was right?
* Was my initial guess very close?
* Do I really understand what she was saying?
* Was I pretending that I knew more about something than I really do?

If you're full of yourself, you won't ask these questions, or you won't be able to answer them honestly.

# knowledge

Knowledge is not a bunch of facts, but the structure and relationship of those facts.


# experience

# judgement
